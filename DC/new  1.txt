Hello!

I use SP5600A.
I want to measure dark count rate, so I tried to use SiPM Kit Control Software.
If I use SP5600 and DT5720A, I don't have any problems(Screenshot_1, install_1).

I want to use another (not SP5600) Power Supply and Amplification Unit and measure the staircase again (install_2).
Unfortunately, your program don't work in this case (Screenshot_2).
At the same time I do have signal (Screenshot_3).

And I see something strange: if I turn on voltage on the ch.1 of the SP5600 I get staircase.
Is this staircase correct or wrong?

I don't have opportunity to check this.
